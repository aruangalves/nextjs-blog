Remember that every client component, defined at the top as:
'use client';
Will transform any imported component as a client component, regardless if these components were set as server or child components in their own function definitions.

A way to avoid this behavior is to NOT directly import these components inside your client component, just pass them as a {children} parameter. Example:

'use client'

export function ClientComponent({children}: {children: React.ReactNode}){
  return (
    <div>
       YOUR CLIENT COMPONENT
       {children}
    </div>
  );

}

Any component inside {children} will remain in their default mode (server or client).
