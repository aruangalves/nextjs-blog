NextJS components by default use server side rendering, which implies that behavior that wouldn't work on React components such as async components are allowed.
Keep in mind that while defining "use client", to avoid parsing sensitive information on it (e.g. "SECRET_KEY"). This info may leak and become accessible during client rendering.

Interactivity, event handlers, window manipulation and local storage are disallowed during server rendering. This code will break with server rendering:
<h1
onClick={() => alert(123)}
>
  EXAMPLE TITLE TEXT
</h1>
To convert to an entire component to Client Component, define:
'use client';
On top of component file
